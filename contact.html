        Violent crime is very rare on Taniti, but as tourism increases, there

        Taniti enjoys a large number of national holidays, and many tourist
        attractions and restaurants will be closed on holidays, so visitors
        should plan accordingly.

        Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, but many businesses will
        also accept euros and yen. Several banks facilitate currency exchange,
        and many businesses accept major credit cards.
